Web Sockets: {
    Its a real-time web service, a protocol, which allows us to build realtime web-services. 'Socket.io' is 
    the library used for adding realtime communication to our node app.
}

How It Works: {
    In a typical node app, the user will send a req to the server and the server will return a response for that
    req, either as json data or as a rendered view. So, the user always have to make a req, to get a response.

    However, there are senarios where the server needs to send some res to the user or users, even if the user
    didn't make a req to the server. Ex=> In a chat app, user-1 sends some msg to user-2 which goes to the server 
    and then is sent to user-2 as a response, even though user-2 didn'n make any req to the server.
    Here, we'll use the web socket protocol, instead of http. Web Socket is built upon http.
}

http vs web sockets: {
    In http, the communnication btw client & server happens via req-res. 
    In Web Sockets, it is push data. The server pushes data to the client.
    We can use both http and web-sockets together, in a single app.
}

socket.io {
    This is one of the most popular package for using web-socket protocol.

    Adding it to our project: {
        We've to add socket.io both on the client and server side to enable communication btw client and 
        server via web-sockets.

    1. Install the package called 'socket.io'.
    2. Inside the main file, which starts the server(app.js), we will setup the 'socket.io', just as we setup
        our other routes for noraml http reqs. Since both uses diff protocols, web sockets req won't interfare
        with normal http req.    
    3. Setting up the connection: {
        Once we connect to our db, we start our server i.e. app.listen(3000).  After starting the server, we'll 
        setup our connection => const io = require('socket.io'); 
        This package exposes a function which expects our server argument. Therefore,
        const server = app.listen(3000);
        const io = require('socket.io')(server)

        As mention above that the web-sockets is built upon http, we have passed our server to it, since our server
        uses http.

        Now the 'io' object gives us some event listeners. Ex-> 
        io.on('connection', socket => {
            console.log('Client Connected');
        });  Now, the 'on' event-listener will be fired everytime a new client is connected.
    }    
    }

socket.io-client: {
    After setting Socket.IO on the server, we'll also install and import 'socket.io-client' on the client side. 
    const openSocket = require('socket.io-client');
    Then inside the 
    'componentDidMount', add openSocket('http://localhost:3000'); 

    With this setup, the socket connection btw the client & server gets established. Now for every new req, the io.on will 
    execute.
 }

Identifing Potential: {
    We can add the functionality where user-1 creats a post and user-2 instantly see it. For that, we have to tweek both front-end
    and back-end. We will define a function in the 'feed.js' to update the dom instantly, whenever a post is created.
    But right now, we are not calling this function. The idea is to call this function whenever a new post is created, by some 
    other client. 
    For that, inside our REST API-> feed.js-> createPost handler, the idea is to inform all clients, whenever a post is created.
    For that, we'll be needing the io connection which we setup in 'app.js'. 
} 

Sharing IO Instance Across Files: {
    Will create a separate 'socket.io' file. 
    const io;

    module.exports = {
        init: httpServer => {
        io = require('socket.io')(httpServer)
        return io;
        },
        getIO: () => {
            if(!io) 
            throw new error('Socket.io not initialized')
            return io;
        }
        Now we can simply import this file to use the 'io' instance at any place in our app.
    };

    Inside the app.js, 
    const server = app.listen(3000);
        const io = require('./socket').init(server)

}
    Now, In the 'feed.js' of REST API, in the 'createPost' handler, we'll first import the 'socket.io' file. Then right after we
    create and save our post, we will, before sending a response, we will inform all other clients about the new post.
    io.getIO().emit('posts' {action: 'create', post: post})
    The event now is 'posts' and the action is 'create' and post is our post object. Here, 'emit' will send the post to all our
    client.

    Adjust the front-end: {
        Inside the 'componentDIdMount', we will listen to the data coming from 'socket.io'. 
        const socket = openSocket('http://localhost:3000');
        socket.on('posts', data => {
            if(data === 'create') {
                this.addPost(data.post);
            }
        })
    }
 We can use the io instance for deleting and updating the post too.
